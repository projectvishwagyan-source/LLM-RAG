## 🚀 The Vision
**Vishwagyan** is an indigenous AI ecosystem built to democratize high-quality education in India. We are bridging the linguistic and informational divide by providing factually accurate, contextually aware, and culturally rooted knowledge in native Indian languages.

### 🇮🇳 The "Bharat Test"
Standard global LLMs often struggle with:
- **Linguistic Nuances:** Poor translation of complex Indian terminologies.
- **Factuality:** Frequent hallucinations in historical and constitutional contexts.
- **Resource Gap:** 90% of high-quality competitive exam content is currently gated behind the English language.

**Vishwagyan solves this.**

## 🎯 Phase 1: The UPSC Proof-of-Concept
We have chosen the **UPSC (Union Public Service Commission)** exam as our starting point. If an AI can master the complexity, depth, and ethics required for India's toughest exam, it can scale to any educational domain.

- **Data Grounding:** Every response is verified through a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline.
- **Verified Sources:** Grounded in NCERTs, PIB (Press Information Bureau), Official Gazettes, and standard reference books (e.g., Laxmikanth, Ramesh Singh).
- **Multilingual Delivery:** Real-time synthesis in **Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and 7+ other Indic languages.**
